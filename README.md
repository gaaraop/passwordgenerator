# passwordgenerator

This is a random password generator made using JS with a minimal of HTML and CSS. 

Usually, Accounts require a strong password for our own safety and privacy. So this project would help us to create a string of random characters which can be used as a password. You can define your length of your password along with the inclusion/exclusion of UpperCase,LowerCase,Numbers,Symbols according to your wish.

You can download the zip or can clone the code and run using VScode.

Major credits to Transversy Media and Florin Pop for the idea and the explaination of the code.
Cheers!
